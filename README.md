# Bi-directional Level Shifter

This PCB is an implementation of four independent nMOS based bi-directional level shifters. The design is based on [Sparkfun BOB-12009](https://github.com/sparkfun/Logic_Level_Bidirectional) and [Adafruit #757](https://github.com/adafruit/4-Channel-Level-Shifter-PCB). The layout is effectively copied from Sparkfun's version, with minor changes for readability and branding, and for a lower price in the very high quantity that we go through.

All designs are based on [Phillips AN97055](Documentation/an97055.pdf)/[NXP AN10441](Documentation/AN10441.pdf). The used MOSFET is a BSS-138. The specific version used on the first production run was [LCSC Part C713688](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/Lge-BSS138/C713688) [(datasheet)](Documentation/2008011839_LGE-BSS138_C713688.pdf)

The released files can be directly uploaded to JLCPCB, as can the assembly data, for large panels to be ordered.
